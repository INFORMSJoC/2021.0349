# Data for replication

In this directory, we put all the sources codes on which we tested the customized control-flow tracing.  Most of the codes are available from  
[Software-artifact Infrastructure Repository](https://sir.csc.ncsu.edu/portal/index.php).  In all cases, we used the first version (v0 or v1) of the code in the repository.

The script run-all.sh in this directory is a demonstrate of how to run the applications, especially as many of the applications could require special compiler flags to compile correctly.  Please read the csi-cc documentation to learn additional specific compiler flags.
